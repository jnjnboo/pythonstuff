## Python end of class project
This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Wazeâ€™s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 

 - Who are the users most likely to churn?
 - Why do users churn? 
 - When do users churn?
